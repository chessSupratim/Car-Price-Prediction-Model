# 🚗 📈 Auto-Insight: Predicting Ownership, Usage, Price and Insights from Indian Car Listings
 
A **Data Science Project** is developed to get the Price of Cars for Indian Cars. The main work- data cleaning, eda, *Machine Learning* models development & evaluations are done in `.ipynb` file. We have also built a dashboard to view the results which is built using **Streamlit** that predicts the price of a car based on its features.  
Users can choose between multiple trained models and compare their predictions visually.

## 📊 Project Overview
 
This app demonstrates an **end-to-end Data Science workflow**:
 
1. Data collection & cleaning  
2. Feature engineering and preprocessing  
3. EDA
4. Model development, training, evaluation & saving (`joblib`)  
5. Interactive Dashboard deployment with **Streamlit**

<br>
> Interactive Dashboard <i>(Streamlit)</i>: `https`

Users can:
- Select a car record from a cleaned dataset (`cleanedCars.csv`)
- Choose one or more machine learning models
- View predicted vs actual prices in an interactive bar chart
- See which model performs best for that specific car (smallest prediction error)
